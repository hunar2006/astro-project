model for predicting habitability of exoplanets using PHL dataset

This project predicts the habitability of exoplanets using data from the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) dataset. The model uses features like stellar type, orbital period, and surface temperature to determine whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone and capable of supporting life. The project utilizes a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify exoplanets as potentially habitable or not.

The goal is to help astronomers identify and prioritize exoplanets for further study by predicting their likelihood to support life.
